# Hello, Dev

Thank you for embarking on this journey with us to create an ambitious and exciting developer experience that is continuously improving. üéâüéâüéâ

Expresso TS is so simple yet efficient in getting the job done. We want to continue doing that, abstract all the complexities that the software development world brings and make it easy for you to build your next project.

If you think about it, every programming language feature, framework built, is to accelerate your development process, however we are continuously failing in delivering good documentation, good developer experience (**everything should simply work**), plus reducing the amount of boilerplate code you have to write.

This is our commitment, to make your life easier, and to make you more productive.

We are very open to feedback, ideas, and contributions. We are a community-driven project, and we want to hear from you.

Thank you again for being part of this journey with us, Happy Coding! üöÄ
