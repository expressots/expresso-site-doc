# Application

The `App` class is the core of an ExpressoTS application, handling server creation and configuration.
It allows you to set up middleware and providers during the bootstrapping process and offers lifecycle hooks
to run code before, after, and during server shutdown.

## App express

`AppExpress` is the [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) platform implementation specifically designed for ExpressoTS.
It integrates seamlessly with the Express.js ecosystem, providing a robust foundation for building
and configuring applications within ExpressoTS.

With full support for Express.js middleware, `AppExpress` enables developers to efficiently manage application setup, execution, and shutdown processes,
all while leveraging the familiar Express.js environment.

:::info
The framework currently supports Express as its primary adapter, with Fastify and other possible in house server under development.
:::

Here is the `App` class extending the `AppExpress` adapter:

```typescript title="app.provider.ts"
export class App extends AppExpress {
    private middleware: IMiddleware;
    private provider: ProviderManager;

    constructor() {
        super();
        this.middleware = container.get<IMiddleware>(Middleware);
        this.provider = container.get(ProviderManager);
    }

    protected configureServices(): void {
        this.provider.register(Env);

        this.middleware.addBodyParser();
        this.middleware.setErrorHandler();
    }

    protected postServerInitialization(): void {
        if (this.isDevelopment()) {
            this.provider.get(Env).checkAll();
        }
    }

    protected serverShutdown(): void {}
}
```

-   `this.provider`: an object containing a register method that allows developers to register internal
    or external ExpressoTS-compatible providers. This method registers classes in the ExpressoTS container
    to be part of the dependency injection system, enabling the use of different scopes such as Transient, Scoped, and Singleton.

-   `this.middleware`: offers a set of out-of-the-box middlewares that can be used to configure your application.
    See the complete list in the **[Middleware section](../features/middleware.mdx)**

:::tip
Be sure to explore other functionalities available in the class through `this`, like setGlobalRoutePrefix(), setEngine(), and more.

## Lifecycle hooks

An ExpressoTS application and its components follow a lifecycle managed by the framework.
ExpressoTS offers lifecycle hooks that let developers track important events and run specific
code within modules, providers, or controllers as these events happen.

The diagram below shows the sequence of key lifecycle events, from application startup to when the Node.js process exits.

```typescript title="Add any service to initialize before the server starts."
protected configureServices(): void | Promise<void> { }
```

```typescript title="Add any service to run after the server starts."
protected postServerInitialization(): void | Promise<void> { }
```

```typescript title="Add any service to run after the server shuts down."
protected serverShutdown(): void | Promise<void> { }
```

## Method isDevelopment

It is a helper method that returns a boolean value indicating whether the application is running in development mode.
This method is useful for running specific code only in development environments.

```typescript title="Check if the application is running in development mode."
this.isDevelopment(): boolean
```

Currently this method is being used in the `postServerInitialization` method to check if the application is running in development mode.
If it is, the `Env` provider is used to check all environment variables.

```typescript title="Check all environment variables in development mode."
protected postServerInitialization(): void {
    if (this.isDevelopment()) {
        this.provider.get(Env).checkAll();
    }
}
```

## Set global route prefix

You can set a global prefix for all routes in your application. This is useful when you want to version your APIs.

```typescript
@provide(App)
class App extends AppExpress {
    private middleware: IMiddleware;
    private provider: IProvider;

    constructor() {
        super();
        this.middleware = container.get<IMiddleware>(Middleware);
        this.provider = container.get<IProvider>(Provider);
    }

    protected configureServices(): void {
        this.setGlobalRoutePrefix("/v1");
    }
}
```
