# First steps

Begin your journey with ExpressoTS! These guides will help you learn and get familiarized with the essential building blocks of ExpressoTS.

## Philosophy

ExpressoTS streamlines server-side development by emphasizing clear and structured code. Ideal
for both simple APIs and complex systems, ExpressoTS accelerates development and ensures timely, high-quality delivery.

ExpressoTS is a [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) framework fully integrated with the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [Expressjs](https://expressjs.com/) ecosystem. While TypeScript is the primary language,
ExpressoTS is fully compatible with JavaScript, and we plan to support other runtimes soon.

In this tutorial, we’ll use TypeScript for most examples, but feel free to switch to vanilla JavaScript if that suits you better.

## Pre-requisites

Please make sure that [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) `version >=18.0.0` is installed on your operating system.

## Setup

Install the **[ExpressoTS CLI](../cli/overview.md)** globally using NPM to get started with your project setup:

Setting up a new ExpressoTS project is quite simple with **[ExpressoTS CLI](../cli/overview.md)**. First install the CLI globally with `NPM`:

```bash
npm i -g @expressots/cli
```

Create a new project by running:

```bash
expressots new project-name
```

## Project templates

ExpressoTS provides two project templates to cater to different development needs:

-   Non-opinionated: Provides flexibility in project structure and resource scaffolding, with minimal setup.
-   Opinionated: Pre-configured for complex projects, enforcing a specific structure and scaffolding pattern.

#### Non-opinionated project structure

```tree
project-name/
├── src/
│   ├── app.container.ts
│   ├── app.controller.ts
│   ├── app.module.ts
│   ├── app.provider.ts
│   ├── main.ts
├── test/
│   ├── app.controller.spec.ts
```

| File Name                                               | Description                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| <span class="span-table"> app.container.ts</span>       | Dependency injection container. Organizes the application modules. |
| <span class="span-table"> app.controller.ts</span>      | A basic controller with a single route.                            |
| <span class="span-table"> app.module.ts</span>          | Application root module.                                           |
| <span class="span-table"> app.provider.ts</span>        | Application global configuration file.                             |
| <span class="span-table"> main.ts</span>                | The main entry point of an ExpressoTS application.                 |
| <span class="span-table"> app.controller.spec.ts</span> | Unit test for the app.controller.                                  |

| <span class="span-table"> env.ts</span>              | This is an utility resource that maps .env variables.                                         |

:::info
Opinionated projects have a different scaffold pattern in addition to the non-opinionated projects. They are pre-configured for complex projects, enforcing
a specific structure and name convention.
:::

The main entry point `main.ts` of an ExpressoTS application is where the application is initialized. This file is responsible for bootstrapping
the application and starting the server.

```typescript
async function bootstrap() {
    const app = await AppFactory.create(container, App);
    await app.listen(3000, ServerEnvironment.Development);
}

bootstrap();
```

The `AppFactory` class is responsible for creating the application instance. The `create` method accepts the container and the application class as parameters. The `App`
class is the application root module, which is responsible for initializing the application and its dependencies.

The `listen` method starts the server on the specified port and environment. You can also pass an object specifying the app's name and version.

:::info
All application configuration and setup are handled in the `App` class.
:::

The `AppFactory` was designed to support multiple web servers like Express.js, Fastify, and more. Currently, it only supports Express.js.

## Running the application

With your application set up, you can start your development server, build your application, or run it in production mode.

Development mode

```bash
✔️ npm run dev
```

Build the application

```bash
✔️ npm run build
```

Production mode

```bash
✔️ npm run prod
```

Once the application is up and running, you can access it by navigating to <span class="span-table">http://localhost:3000/</span>.
You should see <span class="span-table">Hello from ExpressoTS!</span> displayed on the screen.

## Linter and formatter

ExpressoTS uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to enforce code quality and consistency. You can run the following commands to lint and format your code:

```bash
✔️ npm run lint
```

```bash
✔️ npm run format
```
