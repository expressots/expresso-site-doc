# Introduction

ExpressoTS is a TypeScript lightweight framework for building scalable, readable and maintainable server-side applications.
The framework provides a level of abstraction on top of common HTTP server framework **[Expressjs](https://expressjs.com/)** exposing their API's directly to the developer. This provides freedom and brings to the developer a tool that is well known and easy to use.

## Philosophy

ExpressoTS is a developer-friendly framework designed to streamline the process of building server-side applications. With a focus on readability, maintainability, and scalability, ExpressoTS aims to simplify the development process by providing a clear and concise structure.

Gone are the days of tedious setup tasks such as configuring logging systems, handling authentication, and connecting to databases. With ExpressoTS, developers can focus on what really matters - writing code. The framework takes care of the repetitive and time-consuming aspects of development, allowing developers to work more efficiently.

One of the key features of ExpressoTS is its flexible and extensible architecture. The framework provides a robust and powerful **[Dependency Injection](di.md)** system that enables developers to quickly and easily extend its functionality by creating and adding providers with their specific binding scope such as `Transient, Scoped, Singleton`. This allows developers to seamlessly integrate new features throughout the entire application without having to worry about the complexities of integration and coupling.

Whether you're building a simple API or a complex enterprise application, ExpressoTS can help you deliver your project on time and on budget. With a comprehensive set of tools and features, ExpressoTS makes it easy to build high-quality, scalable, and maintainable server-side applications.

## Installing the CLI

To start a new ExpressoTS project, you have two options: create a new project using [ExpressoTS CLI](../cli/overview.md) or clone the initial project from GitHub. While both methods produce the same result, we recommend using the Expresso CLI to create a new project as it offers a more streamlined experience.

## Creating a new project

To create a project using the CLI, simply run the following commands. The CLI will prompt you with a few questions and then create a new project directory with the name you provide, along with the @expressots/core package and a starter project structure.

```bash
npm i -g @expressots/cli
expressots new <project-name>
```

Or you can create projects without going through the CLI questions by passing the template name (opinionated or non-opinionated) and the package manager (npm, yarn or pnpm) as arguments.

```bash
expressots new <project-name> -t <template-name> -p <package-manager>
```

:::tip
ExpressoTS offers two starter project options: opinionated and non-opinionated.

- Use the non-opinionated starter project when you need flexibility on your project structure.
- Choose the opinionated starter project for more complex projects with a complete starting point.
:::

### Cloning the initial project

To install the TypeScript starter project with Git, run the following commands:

```bash
# non-opinionated
git clone --sparse https://github.com/expressots/expressots.git templates/non_opinionated --filter=blob:none 
```

```bash
# opinionated
git clone --sparse https://github.com/expressots/expressots.git templates/opinionated --filter=blob:none 
```

### Accessing your project

After creating your project you can access it by running the following command:

```bash
cd <your-project-option>
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Executing in development mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Generating production build

```bash
npm run build
```

### Executing in production mode

```bash
npm run prod
```

:::note
Note that the `--sparse` option requires Git to be installed at version 2.25 or higher to work properly.
