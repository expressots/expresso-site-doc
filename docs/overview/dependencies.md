# Dependencies

The purpose of this section is to list all dependencies used by ExpressoTS and our vision about dependency management.

## Dependency management

We know that having dependencies accelerates the development process, but it also increases the project complexity and the maintenance cost. Also, another aspect that we consider is the security risks that a dependency can bring to the project.

Our goal is to keep the number of dependencies as low as possible, trying to use only the ones that are really necessary and not part of our core Expresso TS framework mechanics. With that in mind we have in the Roadmap some of the dependencies that we would like to replace by our own implementation. More news about that soon.

In this meanwhile we will keep watching closely the dependencies, using tools like **[Dependabot](https://dependabot.com/)** to keep them up to date and also using tools like **[Snyk](https://snyk.io/)** to keep an eye of the security risks.
