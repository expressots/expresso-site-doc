# Global config file

The ExpressoTS configuration file is located in the root folder of the project and it's called `expressots.config.ts`.
This file is used to configure the CLI and the project behavior.

Here is the current configuration file with all the available options:

```typescript title="expressots.config.ts"
import { ExpressoConfig, Pattern } from "@expressots/core";

const config: ExpressoConfig = {
    sourceRoot: "src",
    scaffoldPattern: Pattern.KEBAB_CASE,
    opinionated: true,
    scaffoldSchematics: {
        entity: "entity",
        provider: "provider",
        module: "module",
        controller: "controller",
        dto: "dto",
        middleware: "middleware",
        usecase: "useCases",
    },
};

export default config;
```

## Configuration options

-   **sourceRoot**: the root folder that will be used by the CLI to create the resources. Default: `src`

-   **scaffoldPattern**: the pattern that will be used to create the resources. Default: `Pattern.KEBAB_CASE`. Example: `user-create`

-   **opinionated**: if true, the CLI will create the resources using the opinionated folder structure

-   **scaffoldSchematics**: the folder convention names for each resource. Default: `useCases`, `entities`, `providers`, `middlewares`, `controllers`, `dtos`. With scaffold schematics you can customize the folder and resource names.

:::caution
Scaffold schematics are only designed for the non-opinionated template. The opinionated template has a predefined structure.

## Recommendations

Try to use as many different forms of creating resources as possible. This will help you to understand how the CLI works and how to use it in your favor. It also helps us improve the CLI to make it more robust.
