# Overview

The ExpressoTS CLI is a command-line interface tool that helps you to `create` ExpressoTS projects and `scaffold` the application resources such as use cases, controllers, dto's, providers and services.

:::info
We use in this tutorial the `npm` package manager, but you can use your favorite package manager such as `yarn` or `pnpm`.
:::

## Installation üíª

First install the CLI globally using the command below:

```bash
npm install -g @expressots/cli
```

## Basic usage

```bash
expressots <command> [options]
```

### Help

Verify the available commands and options:

```bash
expressots --help
```

### Version

Verify the CLI version:

```bash
expressots --version
```

## Create a project

There are two options to create a new project, interactively or silently (passing the options as arguments)

### Interactively

```bash
expressots new <project-name>
```

### Silently

```bash
expressots new <project-name> -p <package-manager> -t <template>
```

- **package-manager**: `npm`, `yarn` or `pnpm`
- **template**: `opinionated` or `non-opinionated`
