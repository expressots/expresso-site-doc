# Generate

In order to provide a better developer experience, the ExpressoTS CLI provides a set of commands to help you scaffold the application resources such as use cases, controllers, DTO's, providers and services.

This command allows developers to stay ahead of the curve by generating the boilerplate code for the application, so they can focus on the business logic.

## Command Syntax

The generate command can be executed as follows:

```bash
expressots generate <resource> <structure> [options]
```

Or in its short form:

```bash
expressots g <resource> <structure> [options]
```

### Command Structure

We provide two different structures to scaffold the resources:

-   **[shorthand]**: `expressots generate service user-create`
    This will create this folder structure: `/user/create` and the file: `user-create.[resource].ts`

-   **[folder/subfolder/resource]**: `expressots generate service user/create`
    This will create this folder structure: `/user/create` and the file: `create.[resource].ts`

    If you add `/` at the end of the structure, the CLI will create the resource inside of the folder. Example: `expressots generate service user/create/`
    Structure: `user/create/` and the file: `create.[resource].ts`

### Resource Root Folder

-   The root folder for all resources is the `src` folder. This can be changed in the `expressots.config.ts` file.
-   In the opinionated mode, the root folder is the `src` folder and the resources scaffolded with `service, usecase, dto, controller` are created inside of the `useCases` folder.
-   Entities are created inside of the `entities` folder, and providers inside of the `providers` folder.

## Resource Types

Current available resources:

| Long form  | short | Command                    | Expected result                                                                          |
| ---------- | ----- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| usecase    | u     | expressots g u user/find   | Use case to be created in the folder `useCases` with this folder structure: user/find    |
| controller | c     | expressots g c user/find   | Controller to be created in the folder `useCases` inside of user/find                    |
| dto        | d     | expressots g d user/find   | DTO to be created in the folder `useCases` inside of user/find                           |
| provider   | p     | expressots g p email/email | Provider to be created in the folder `providers` inside of user/find                     |
| service    | s     | expressots g s user/find   | Service creates usecase, controller and DTO and add them in the desired folder user/find |
| entity     | e     | expressots g e user        | Entity to be created in the folder `entities` with this folder structure: user           |
| middleware | mi    | expressots g mi auth       | Middleware to be created in the folder `middlewares` with this folder structure: auth    |
| module     | mo    | expressots g mo user       | Module to be created in the folder where `controllers` and `usecases` are located        |

All resources can be created using the structure `folder/subfolder/resource`.

## Scaffolding Using Shorthand Operation

For services, you can take advantage of creating the use case, controller and DTO at once using the structure `entity_action` or `entity-action`. Example:

```bash
expressots g s user-create
```

:::info
The `expressots.config.ts` configuration file, located in the project root folder, determines where all resources will be created. Also determine the resource names for each type of resource.
