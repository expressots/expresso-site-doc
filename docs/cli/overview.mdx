# Overview

The CLI (command-line interface) tool helps you to create ExpressoTS projects and scaffold ExpressoTS resources.

We use the `npm` in this tutorial for simplicity. However, you can use your preferred package manager (`yarn` or `pnpm`) by replacing `npm` with the appropriate command.

## Installation

First install the CLI globally using the command below:

```bash
npm install -g @expressots/cli
```

## Commands available

The CLI provides the following commands:

| Name        | Alias   | Description                                           |
| ----------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| new project | new     | Generate a new project                                |

| entity      | g e     | Generate an entity                                    |
| provider    | g p     | Generate internal provider                            |
| provider    | add     | Add external provider to the project                  |
| provider    | remove  | remove external provider                              |
| provider    | create  | Create external provider                              |
| module      | g mo    | Generate a module                                     |
| middleware  | g mi    | Generate a middleware                                 |

## Usage examples

You can use the CLI either with:

- `expressots`
- `ex` as an alias.

Command example:

```bash
expressots <command> [options]

// Or

ex <command> [options]
```

## Help command

Verify the available commands and options:

```bash
expressots help
```

## Info command

Providers information about your Operational System, Project and CLI version:

```bash
expressots info
```

## Resources list

List all available resources to scaffold:

```bash
expressots resources (Alias: r)
```

## Create a project

There are two options to create a new project, interactively or silently (passing the options as arguments).
Here is the complete command syntax:

```bash title="Create project command options"
expressots new <project-name> -p <package-manager> -t <template> -d <directory>
```

#### Interactively

```bash
expressots new <project-name>
```

#### Silently

```bash
expressots new <project-name> -p <package-manager> -t <template> -d <directory>
```

-   **package-manager**: `npm`, `yarn` or `pnpm`
-   **template**: `opinionated` or `non-opinionated`
-   **directory**: `./my-project`

The flag `-d` is optional and is used to specify the directory where the project will be created. If not specified, the project will be created in the current directory.

## Add a provider

Add an external provider to the project:

```bash
expressots add <provider-name>
```

Although you can add npm registry packages, the primary use case for this command is to add providers that were built specifically for ExpressoTS.

:::info Watch for updates of our Providers App Store.
:::

## Create a provider

Create a new ExpressoTS provider. For more information about providers, check the [Providers](../core/providers.mdx#create-external-provider) section.

```bash
expressots create <provider-name>
```

## Scaffold resources

The CLI provides commands to scaffold resources like `controller`, `usecase`, `dto`, `entity`, `module` and `middleware`.

```bash
expressots generate <resource> <name> [options]
```

Resources are created in the `src` directory by default. They also can be scaffolded in 2 different ways: `passing the path` or using the `shorthand operation`.

:::caution
The resource scaffolding operations produce different results based on the project template used. The `opinionated` template provides a more structured project, while the `non-opinionated` template provides a more flexible project structure.
:::

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="non-opinionated" label="Non Opinionated">

#### Passing the path

```bash title="Create a controller named user inside the services directory"
expressots g c services/user
```

```bash title="Output"
src
└── services
    └── user.controller.ts
```

#### Shorthand operation

```bash title="Create a controller named services-user inside the services/user directory"
expressots g c services-user
```

```bash title="Output"
src
└── services
    └── user
        └── services-user.controller.ts
```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="opinionated" label="Opinionated">

In the `opinionated` template, the scaffolded resources are created following a predefined structure.

-   [@providers](../core/providers.mdx)
-   [@entities](../core/entities.mdx)
-   [@useCases](../core/usecase.mdx)
-   [@repositories](../guides/repositories.mdx)

#### Passing the path

```bash title="Create a controller named user inside the useCases/services directory"
expressots g c services/user
```

The command above will create a controller named `user` inside the `useCases/services` directory.

```bash title="Output"
src
└── useCases
    └── services
        └── user.controller.ts
```

:::note dto, usecase, controller, modules will be created in the `useCases` directory.
:::

#### Shorthand operation

```bash title="Create a controller named services-user inside the useCases/services/user directory"
expressots g c services-user
```

The command above will create a controller named `services-user` inside the `useCases/services/user` directory.

```bash title="Output"
src
└── useCases
    └── services
        └── user
            └── services-user.controller.ts
```

:::info
Using the shorthand operation in the opinionated template offers significant benefits. It creates a well-structured project that's easier to navigate and understand. When you scaffold with the shorthand, the CLI automatically places resources in the correct directories, adds controllers to their modules, and integrates the module into the container.
