# File upload

File uploads are a common requirement in web applications, allowing users to upload files like images, videos, documents, etc. to the server.
In ExpressoTS, you can handle file uploads using the `multer` middleware, which simplifies the process of receiving files from the client.

The `multer` middleware handles the multipart/form-data encoding used for file uploads, parsing the incoming request
and storing the files in a specified location on the server.

## Install

Install the `multer` middleware using npm.

```bash
npm i multer && npm i -D @types/multer
```

With `multer` installed in your project, you can now use it to handle file uploads in your ExpressoTS application via `app provider` or on specific routes.

## Usage example

Here's an example of how to use `multer` in the `app.provider.ts` file to handle file uploads.

```typescript title="Create multer object then use it in the router"
@provide(App)
export class App extends AppExpress {
    private middleware: IMiddleware;
    private provider: ProviderManager;

    constructor() {
        super();
        this.middleware = container.get<IMiddleware>(Middleware);
        this.provider = container.get(ProviderManager);
    }

    protected configureServices(): void {
        const file = this.middleware.setupMulter({ dest: "uploads" });

        this.middleware.addMiddleware({
            path: "/",
            middlewares: [file.single("file")],
        });
    }
}
```

In the example above, we create a `multer` object with the destination folder for storing the uploaded files. We then use the `file.single("file")` middleware to handle a single file upload with the field name `file`.

## File upload decorator

You can also use the `@FileUpload` decorator to handle file uploads on specific routes.

```typescript title="File upload decorator"
@FileUpload({ fieldName: "file" }, { dest: "uploads/" })
```

## Single file upload

You can handle single file uploads by specifying the `fieldName` option in the `@FileUpload` decorator.

```typescript title="Single file upload"
@controller("/")
export class AppController {
    @Post("/")
    @FileUpload({ fieldName: "file" }, { dest: "uploads/" })
    execute(@request() req: Request, @response() res: Response) {
        return res.status(200).send("File uploaded successfully");
    }
}
```

In the example above, we use the `@FileUpload` decorator to handle file uploads on the `/` route. The `fieldName` option specifies the field name of the file input, and the `dest` option specifies the destination folder for storing the uploaded files.

## Array of files

You can also handle multiple file uploads by specifying the `maxCount` option in the `@FileUpload` decorator.

```typescript title="Multiple file uploads"
@controller("/")
export class AppController {
    @Post("/")
    @FileUpload({ fieldName: "files", maxCount: 5 }, { dest: "uploads/" })
    execute(@request() req: Request, @response() res: Response) {
        return res.status(200).send("Files uploaded successfully");
    }
}
```

In the example above, we use the `maxCount` option to specify that a maximum of 5 files can be uploaded. The `fieldName` option specifies the field name of the file input, and the `dest` option specifies the destination folder for storing the uploaded files.

## Multiple file fields

You can handle multiple file fields by specifying the `fields` option in the `@FileUpload` decorator.

```typescript title="Multiple file fields"
@controller("/")
export class AppController {
    @Post("/")
    @FileUpload(
        [
            { fieldName: "avatar", maxCount: 1 },
            { fieldName: "gallery", maxCount: 2 },
        ],
        { dest: "fields/" }
    )
    execute(@request() req: Request, @response() res: Response) {
        return res.status(200).send("Files uploaded successfully");
    }
}
```

In the example above, we use an array of objects to specify multiple file fields. Each object contains the `fieldName` and `maxCount` options for the file input fields. The `dest` option specifies the destination folder for storing the uploaded files.

## Any file type

You can allow any file type to be uploaded by specifying the `fileFilter` option in the `@FileUpload` decorator.

```typescript title="Allow any file type"
@controller("/")
export class AppController {
    @Post("/")
    @FileUpload({ any: true })
    execute(@request() req: Request, @response() res: Response) {
        return res.status(200).send("File uploaded successfully");
    }
}
```

In the example above, we use the `any` option to allow any file type to be uploaded. This option bypasses the default file type filter and allows all file types to be uploaded.

## No file type filter

You can disable the file type filter by specifying the `disableFileFilter` option in the `@FileUpload` decorator.

```typescript title="Disable file type filter"
@controller("/")
export class AppController {
    @Post("/")
    @FileUpload({ none: true })
    execute(@request() req: Request, @response() res: Response) {
        return res.status(200).send("No file uploaded, form data received");
    }
}
```

:::caution
Make sure to add `@request()` and `@response()` decorators to the route handler method to access the request and response objects properly.
:::

Make sure to explore the [multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer) documentation for more options and configurations to handle file uploads in your ExpressoTS application.

The @FileUpload decorator supports all the options provided by multer.
