# Governance

ExpressoTS is built by its community. We welcome and appreciate contributions of all kinds. There are many ways to help, from reporting issues, contributing code, and helping us improve our community.

## Core Team

Currently we have a small core team of constant contributors. We are looking to expand this team to include more people from the community with a wide range of skills and interests.

This team is currently overseeing the following items:

- Documentation
- Site
- Community Management
- Social Media Presence
- Technical Support
- ExpressoTS Core, CLI and Providers
- ExpressoTS Extra Packages
- ExpressoTS Features and Innovations
- ExpressoTS Issues and Pull Requests
- DevOps
- CI/CD
- Testing
- Roadmap

## Decision Making

Each major decision in ExpressoTS starts with a proposal. Proposals can be written by anyone in the community. The core team will review the proposal and decide whether to accept it, reject it, or ask for more information.

:::caution SPOILER ALERT
We are moving the project board and roadmap from Jira to GitHub Projects. This will allow us to have a more open and transparent process, as well as allow the community to participate more actively in the project.
