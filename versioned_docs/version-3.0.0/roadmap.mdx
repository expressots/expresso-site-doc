# Roadmap

The roadmap is a high-level overview of the upcoming features and improvements we plan to make to ExpressoTS. It is a living document and will be updated as we complete work and plan for future releases.

There are also many features and improvements that are not listed here because they are either too small to mention or we have not yet decided when they will be exposed to the public.

## Working packages

Working packages are a way to group related tasks together. They are a way to organize the work that needs to be done and to help us prioritize what to work on next.

![Roadmap Components](./core/img/roadmap-component.png)

> -   **Enhanced:** ExpressoTS streamlined workflow and improved the developer experience.

> -   **Support:** ExpressoTS supports the feature and provides the necessary tools to use it.

> -   **Non existent:** The feature is not yet available in ExpressoTS but maybe is in development or planned.
