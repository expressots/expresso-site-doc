# Container

ExpressoTS uses an IoC Container for dependency injection, making it easy to manage object creation, resolution, and lifecycle.

## Setup

The application container can be customized to enhance flexibility in dependency management through the following options:

-   **defaultScope**:
    -   Request Scope: Creates a new instance of a dependency for each request.
    -   Singleton Scope: Creates a single instance shared across all requests.
    -   Transient Scope: Creates a new instance every time the dependency is requested.
-   **skipBaseClassChecks**: When enabled, the container skips base class checks for derived classes, providing more flexibility.
-   **autoBindInjectable**: When enabled, the container automatically injects classes that are not explicitly bound.

Here is the interface options definition:

```typescript
interface ContainerOptions {
    defaultScope?: interfaces.BindingScope;
    skipBaseClassChecks?: boolean;
    autoBindInjectable: false;
}
```

## Creating the container

```typescript
private config: AppContainer = this.configContainer([AppModule], {
        autoBindInjectable: true,
        defaultScope: "Request",
        skipBaseClassChecks: true,
});
```

## Modules registration

The `Container` facilitates module registration via its `configContainer([])` method, which accepts an array of modules.

Here an example of PaymentModule creation:

```typescript title="payment.module.ts"
export const PaymentModule: ContainerModule = CreateModule([CreatePaymentController]);
```

```typescript title="Module registration"
private config: AppContainer = this.configContainer([AppModule, PaymentModule]);
```

:::tip
When scaffolding a new module using the Opinionated template, the module is automatically registered in the container.

## Container options

After creating the container, you have the following options available:

-   <span class="span-table">Container Object</span>: Access the container and manage its bindings.
-   <span class="span-table">View Container Bindings</span>: Check the injected classes and their
    scopes. The container can be used to view all the bindings that have been registered. This can
    be useful for debugging purposes or to understand the dependencies that have been registered.
-   <span class="span-table">View Container Options</span>: Review the container's defined options

See below image for a visual representation of the container bindings.

```typescript title="app.ts"
this.config.viewContainerBindings();
```
