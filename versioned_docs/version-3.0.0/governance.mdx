# Governance

ExpressoTS is built by its community. We welcome and appreciate contributions of all kinds. There are many ways to help, from reporting issues, contributing code, and helping us improve our community.

## Decision making

Each major decision in ExpressoTS starts with a proposal. Proposals can be written by anyone in the community. The core team will review the proposal and decide whether to accept it, reject it, or ask for more information.

## How to contribute?

**"This path is arduous but it's very rewarding, you can help to shape the future of backend development!**

The framework is gaining traction globally, and I'm currently managing parallel development efforts from various talented developers like yourself. Apologies if my responses are sometimes delayed!
We’re always looking for passionate contributors, and there’s a straightforward, well-defined process to become part of our selective core development team—a unique aspect compared to many open-source projects.

#### Types of contributors:

        proposal. We appreciate all contributions, no matter how small!
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Core Developer" value="core">
        A dedicated group of developers who not only code but also act as DevRel for the platform.
        As a core developer, you’ll join a team of skilled individuals driving the future of
        ExpressoTS and helping to shape the backend development landscape.

#### How to become a core developer:

To become a core developer, you’ll need to deliver at least three major contributions to the framework, focusing on new functionalities or significant improvements.

Steps to Start Contributing:

1. Explore ExpressoTS: Create a project using ExpressoTS and explore its functionalities, including the Core, Adapter, and CLI.
   Take notes on potential improvements or features you think could be added.

2. Read the Documentation: Understanding the project’s philosophy and technical details is crucial. Make sure to thoroughly read the documentation.

3. Dive into the Codebase: Clone the repository and start familiarizing yourself with the code.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/expressots/expressots.git
```

4. Identify Your Interest Area: Once you're comfortable with the framework, reach out to me with the area you'd like to contribute to. We can schedule a meeting to discuss how to implement or improve that part of the framework.

5. Contribute and Grow: After our discussion, I'll assign you a task. Your contributions will be reviewed, and based on the quality and impact, you may be invited to join the core development team.

6. Additional Tips: Engage with the Community: Join our Discord or other community channels to interact with other contributors and core developers.

7. Star the project on GitHub: expressots/expressots

8. Stay Updated: Keep an eye on the project’s roadmap and open issues on GitHub to find areas where your contributions can make the most impact.
