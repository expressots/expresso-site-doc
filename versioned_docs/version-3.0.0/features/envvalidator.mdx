# Environment validator

The environment validator provider is used to validate the existence of the `.env` file and its content.
It helps the developer to avoid runtime errors caused by missing environment variables.

## Setup

To use the environment validator provider, you need to make sure it is registered in the `configureServices()` method of the `App` class.
Once registered, the provider will be available in the application through the DI Container.

```ts
    protected configureServices(): void | Promise<void> {
        this.provider.register(Env);
    }
```

## Method checkAll

The `checkAll()` method is used to validate the existence of the `.env` file and its content by checking if all the environment variables are defined.

You can define from where to call the `checkAll()` method. It can be called in the `postServerInitialization()` method or in any other method that you prefer.

```ts
    protected postServerInitialization(): void | Promise<void> {
        if (this.isDevelopment()) {
            this.provider.get(Env).checkAll();
        }
    }
```

If the `.env` file is missing or if any environment variable is not defined, the `checkAll()` method will throw an error with a message indicating the missing environment variables.

```bash title="PORT environment variable is missing"
[PID:26759] ERROR [env-validator-provider] Environment variable PORT is not defined.
```

## Method get

The environment validator provider also has a method called `get()` that returns the value of an environment variable. It is used to get a specific environment variable value passing its name as a parameter.

```typescript
this.provider.get(Env).get("PORT");
```

## Using everywhere

You can use the `Env` provider in any class by injecting it into the constructor of your usecase, service, provider, controller or any other class.

```typescript
import { Get, controller } from "@expressots/adapter-express";
import { Env } from "@expressots/core";

@controller("/")
export class AppController {
    constructor(private env: Env) {}

    @Get("/")
    execute(): string {
        console.log(this.env.get("PORT"));
        return "Hello from Expressots!";
    }
}
```
