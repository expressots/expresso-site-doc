# Logging

Logger is a class that provides a set of methods to log messages using native node modules. It is a simple way to log messages in your application and it is already included in the ExpressoTS framework.

Logger take two parameters:

-   message: The message to be logged.
-   module: The service name associated with the log.

## Logger methods

There are 4 methods available:

```typescript title="Logger usage"
log.<method>(message: string, module?: string);
```

-   **info**: Logs an informational message.
-   **warn**: Logs a warning message.
-   **error**: Logs an error message.
-   **msg**: Logs a message.

## Logger format

Using `info()` method as an example, the logger format is:

```
[ExpressoTS] 00/00/0000 00:00:00 PM [PID:30319] INFO [app-controller] Hello from Expressots!
```

## Register logger in the container

The logger is already included in the ExpressoTS framework but first you need to register it in the container. You can do this in the `configureServices` method of your application.

```typescript
export class App extends AppExpress {
    protected configureServices(): void | Promise<void> {
        this.provider.register(Logger);
    }
}
```

## Usage example

Once the logger is registered in the container, you can inject it into your services, controllers, use cases, etc.

```typescript
export class YourUseUseCase {
    constructor(@inject(Logger) private log: Logger) {}

    execute() {
        this.log.info("Testing log message", "your-use-case");
        return "Hello ExpressoTS!";
    }
}
```
